We use the `prior.M` object that, per Wes Crouse, puts 5% prior weight on there being a single allele. 

```{r}
prior.M <- list(model.type = "crp",
                prior.alpha.type = "gamma",
                prior.alpha.shape = 2.3009322,
                prior.alpha.rate = 0.7488104)

TIMBR::TIMBR()
```
